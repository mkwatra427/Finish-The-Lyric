You said I think that we forgot
About our lives as abstract art
I'd never heard something so loud
But I looked down and said "not now"
You put your hand up on my cheek
And said "you're Orpheus and I'm Eurydice"
I had no clue of what you meant
And you grew up and left your head
Yeah your mind was a lot for me
And I'm sorry that I couldn't believe
But like the god damn words of the bible, I will
Live a dream where I'll stick right by them, a disciple
You said I think that we forgot
You're a Cancer and I'm a Capricorn
So I guess we've got something to prove
But I said "don't be childish like I knew"
You put your hand up on my cheek
And said "you're Orpheus and I'm Eurydice"
I now know what you really meant
But you've grown up and left your head
You laid down on my bedroom floor
And said that we're just chemicals
So bring on the birth of tragedy
Bring on the rise of rationality
Cause I've seen it all and
I've still got half my fucking soul
